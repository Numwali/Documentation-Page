Technical Documentation Page
This project is a technical documentation page that provides information about JavaScript, including key concepts and examples. It is designed to meet specific user stories and project requirements, ensuring a responsive, functional, and accessible design.

Features
Dynamic Navbar:

A navigation bar is positioned on the left side of the screen for easy access to all sections.
Links in the navbar navigate to specific sections within the page.
The navbar is responsive and adapts to smaller screens.
Main Content:

Contains several sections covering different topics related to JavaScript.
Each section includes a descriptive header, text content, code examples, and lists for better readability.
Responsive Design:

The page layout adjusts for different screen sizes using media queries.
The navbar becomes a top-bar menu on smaller screens.
User Stories Fulfilled
The page contains a main element with an id of main-doc for the main content.
Within the main-doc element, there are multiple section elements, each with a class of main-section.
Each main-section contains a header element describing its content.
The navbar contains links that navigate to the respective sections of the documentation.
The navbar is always visible on larger screens and collapses for better accessibility on smaller devices.
The design uses at least one media query for responsive layout.
