       <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
          language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
          connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

       <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core 
          set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
          JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
          objects; for example:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>
             Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
             browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions 
             allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
             such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
             Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to 
             running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
             application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
             one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
              <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
              <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the
                  tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

     <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
       <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
       <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The 
          JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type 
          checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic 
          control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
          JavaScript.
      </p>
       <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports 
          a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, 
          and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more 
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic 
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports 
          functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of 
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all 
         variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are 
         public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, 
         parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
      </p>

     <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
       <header>Variables</header>
       <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
          called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
       <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent 
          characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the 
          characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
       </p>
       <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the 
          Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are 
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name
       </p>

     <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
       <header>Data Types</header>
       <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>null:</strong> A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-
               sensitive, <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.</li>
            <li><strong>undefined:</strong> A top-level property whose value is <code>undefined</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Number:</strong> <code>42</code> or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>String:</strong> <code>"Howdy"</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> (new in ECMAScript 2015) A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>and Object:</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful 
        functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements 
        in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as 
        procedures that your application can perform.
