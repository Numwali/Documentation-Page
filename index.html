       <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
       <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>
             Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
             Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>JavaScript's flexibility makes it a powerful tool for both client-side and server-side development.</p>

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
              <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
              <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

       <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
       <p>JavaScript and Java share some syntax similarities...</p>
       <p>However, they differ fundamentally in purpose...</p>
       <code>let x = 10;</code>
       <p>JavaScript is dynamically typed...</p>
       <p>Java enforces strict typing and object orientation...</p>

     <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
       <header>Variables</header>
       <p>Variables store data values in JavaScript...</p>
       <p>They can be declared using var, let, or const...</p>
       <code>const pi = 3.14;</code>
       <p>Variable scope defines where the variable is accessible...</p>
       <p>Block-scoped variables improve safety...</p>

     <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
       <header>Data Types</header>
       <p>JavaScript supports several data types...</p>
       <p>These include strings, numbers, and objects...</p>
       <code>typeof 'Hello';</code>
       <p>Symbols are a new type introduced in ES6...</p>
       <p>Null and undefined represent absence of value...</p>
     </section>
 
     <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
       <header>Functions</header>
       <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code...</p>
       <p>They are declared using the function keyword...</p>
       <code>function greet(name) { return 'Hello, ' + name; }</code>
       <p>Arrow functions provide a concise syntax...</p>
       <p>Functions can be passed as arguments...</p>
