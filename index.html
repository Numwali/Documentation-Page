       <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
          language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
          connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

       <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core 
          set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
          JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
          objects; for example:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>
             Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
             browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions 
             allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
             such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
             Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to 
             running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
             application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
             one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>

         <header>What you should already know</header>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
              <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
              <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the
                  tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
       </section>        
 
     <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
       <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
       <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The 
          JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type 
          checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic 
          control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
          JavaScript.
      </p>
       <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports 
          a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, 
          and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more 
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic 
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports 
          functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of 
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all 
         variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are 
         public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, 
         parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

      <header>Hello world</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <pre><code>
  function greetMe(yourName) { 
      alert("Hello " + yourName); 
  }
  greetMe("World");
      </code></pre>
      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
  </section>
  

     <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
       <header>Variables</header>
       <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
          called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
       <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent 
          characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the 
          characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
       </p>
       <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the 
          Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are 
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name

     <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
       <header>Data Types</header>
       <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>null:</strong> A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-
               sensitive, <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.</li>
            <li><strong>undefined:</strong> A top-level property whose value is <code>undefined</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Number:</strong> <code>42</code> or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>String:</strong> <code>"Howdy"</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> (new in ECMAScript 2015) A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>and Object:</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful 
        functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements 
        in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as 
        procedures that your application can perform.

     <section id="if_else_statement" class="main-section">
      <header>if...else Statement</header>
      <p>Use the <code>if</code> statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional <code>else</code> clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.</p>
      <p>An <code>if</code> statement looks as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>
  if (condition) {
      statement_1;
  } else {
      statement_2;
  }
      </code></pre>
      <p>The <code>condition</code> can be any expression that evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If <code>condition</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, <code>statement_1</code> is executed; otherwise, <code>statement_2</code> is executed.</p>
      <p>You may also compound the statements using <code>else if</code> to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>
  if (condition_1) {
      statement_1;
  } else if (condition_2) {
      statement_2;
  } else {
      statement_last;
  }
      </code></pre>
      <p>To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement <code>{ ... }</code>. It is also good practice to avoid simple assignments in a conditional expression.</p>
      <p>Example of correct usage:</p>
      <pre><code>
  if ((x = y)) {
      // statements here
  }
      </code></pre>
  </section>
  
  <section id="while_statement" class="main-section">
      <header>while Statement</header>
      <p>A <code>while</code> statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to <code>true</code>.</p>
      <p>The syntax of a <code>while</code> loop is as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>
  while (condition) {
      statement;
  }
      </code></pre>
      <p>If the condition becomes <code>false</code>, the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre><code>
  var n = 0;
  var x = 0;
  while (n < 3) {
      n++;
      x += n;
  }
      </code></pre>
      <p>Values of <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> during each iteration:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: <code>n = 1</code> and <code>x = 1</code></li>
          <li>After the second pass: <code>n = 2</code> and <code>x = 3</code></li>
          <li>After the third pass: <code>n = 3</code> and <code>x = 6</code></li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Function_declarations" class="main-section">
      <header>Function Declarations</header>
      <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration or function statement) consists of the <code>function</code> keyword, followed by:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
          <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets <code>{ }</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example of a simple function named <code>square</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>
  function square(number) {
      return number * number;
  }
      </code></pre>
      <p>The <code>square</code> function takes one argument, called <code>number</code>. It returns the square of the input value.</p>
